							<article id = "Purpose">
								<h2 align = center>Purpose & Goal </h2> <hr/>
								
								<p>My main goal of this project is to dive into Unreal's networking framework, while also futher improving my experience in Unreal. </p>
								<p>In terms of game design, my goal is to create a fun, and Nerf-inspired experience in an FPS game.
								</p>
							</article>
							
							<br/><br/>
							<article id = "The project design">
								<h2 align = center>Design</h2> <hr/>
								<p>As the goal is to create a Nerf-inspired experience, the idea was to create a modular gun system, where players could modify their gun during gameplay, similar to how the Nerf Modulus toy line works</p>
								<p>Since the game would be a fast-paced arena shooter, I didn't want to go too deep into weapon modifications, and decided that there should only be 3 categories of modification.</p>
								<ul style = "text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
									<li>Weapon Frame</li>
									<li>Projectile Type</li>									
									<li>Element Battery</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The weapon frame controls how the weapon behaves. IE. shot pattern, fire rate, spread, etc.
								<br/> The projectile type modifies the projectile fired, including visuals, speed, and secondary effects. 
								<br/> The element battery further modifies the projectile fired, adding an element to the projectile which applies special affects to the target</p>

								<p>In terms of player movement, much of their abilities are borrowed from modern shooters, such as clamber, thruster, double jump, etc. My largest reference is Halo 5's character controller.</p>
								<p>While I don't have a unique gamemode designed yet, I want to design one that takes full advantage of the modular gun system.</p>
								<br/>

							<article id = "The project so far">
							
								<h2 align = center>2024 June 03</h2><hr/>
								<p>The project has been put on hold indefinitely, as I begin a new role at Epic Games. </p>
								
							
								<h2 align = center>2024 February 28</h2> <hr/>
								
								<p>Currently, I have a functional networked prototype, including most of the weapons, character abilities, and a basic gamemode loop. The player can join a match, complete a team deathmatch session, and restart the match.</p>
								<p>The framework for the modular guns has been implemented, and I am currently developing their more specialized mechanics (IE. the gravity element and it's gravity mechanic)</p>
								<br/><p>On the design front, I am still thinking about the overall game design. While I believe the weapon framework will mostly stay the same, there are still some elements that I am playtesting, to
								see if they fit into my vision of the game. That said, I am always trying to playtest with others, and get their feedback as well</p>
								<br/><p>After I get the elements, projectiles, and weapon frames mostly developed, I want to start designing a new game mode, but will still implement basic ones like capture the flag, and area control</p>

							<article id = "Design Process">
								<h2 align = center> Design Process </h2> <hr/>				
								<br/>
								<p>I began pre-planning by re-reviewing my design document for my unreal tournament level, as I really liked the process I went through and documented. After
								reviewing it's process, I loosely planned out how I believed my process for this level would progress. This helped me get a better idea of what was necessary for
								the design.
								</p>
								
								<p>In general, my process looked similar to the following list:
								
									<ul>
										<li>Pre-planning / brainstorming</li>
										<li>Diagram layouts</li>
										<li>In-engine metric greybox</li>
										<li>Gameplay elements placements</li>
										<li>Initial art pass</li>
										<li>Playtest</li>
										<li>Fixes & additional art passes</li>
										<li>Second Playtest</li>
										<li>Final Touches</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Typically, I would run a playtest before an initial art pass, just to test geometry, gameplay flow, and balancing, while the set dressing models are being created.
								But, since Forge already had the assets I would be using, going along with the art pass saved time. Additionally, placing some props really helped me get a better
								idea of how players would move about in the different spaces.
								</p>
								<br/>
								
							</article>
							<article id = "PrePlanning">
								<h2 align = center> Pre-Planning</h2> <hr/>				
								<br/>
								<p>I began by thinking of environments that might be interesting for a 12v12. I had a few environments in mind; an underwater base, a forest, and an ice cavern. 
								Ultimately, I decided on creating a level based around a large water dam. I felt that the large drop on one side of the dam would be an interesting play space for
								a Wasp (a flying vehicle), and the ground level of the dam would be a nice large space for both vehicle and foot soldier gameplay.
								</p>
								
								<p>After deciding the environment, I brainstormed some interesting structures that would be great set pieces, while also presenting some great gameplay opportunities.
								I looked to existing dams, as well as existing structures in the Halo universe for some inspiration. In Halo CE, at the beginning of <i>Assault on the Control Room</i> 
								a large forerunner structure is present, and I really liked the design and size of this structure, and I planned for the main structure of my level to look / behave similar to
								it.
								</p>
								
								<p>One aspect that I really wanted to incorporate into this level was verticality in the gameplay. Aside from the Wasp, I wanted players to have the option of climbing up structures 
								and gain some height, as I always enjoyed these types of maps in previous Halos.
								</p>
								<p>After some more brainstorming, and ideation, I began to create some diagrams to map the connections of each space to eachother.</p>
								
							</article>
							<br/>
							<article id = "Diagrams">
								<h2 align = center> Diagrams</h2> <hr/>				
								<br/>
								<p>I started off with some bubble diagrams to get a better idea of how each space should connect to other spaces. This step really helped me identify how the different levels
								of vertical movement should interact with each other, and how players should be able to travel between the different spaces. As these diagrams were from a top-down view, I created
								multiple bubble diagrams, layered on top of each other, and it was easy to switch layers and see the space connections.
								</p>
								<div class = "desktop" align = center>
									<a class="example-image-link" href="images/WaterDamage/BubbleDiagram.gif" data-lightbox="galleryDesktop">
										<img  style = "width: 35%;"   src="images/WaterDamage/BubbleDiagram.gif" alt="" />		
									</a>
								</div>
								
								<p>After creating the bubble diagrams, I wanted to plan out the interior of the central building in the dam. I moved over to a side-view of the building, which allowed me to 
								plan for the elevation. During this step, I planned out the geometry for the building, including aspects like stair/ramp placements, gravity lift placements, and room placements.
								This diagram proved to be extremely helpful in having a better idea of what the interior should look like, which made the scultping, using Forge pieces, much much easier.
								</p>
								<p>I also made a side-view diagram for the team bases, since I found the central building diagram really helped. Since the bases were going to be mirrored, I only created one for the red team.
								</p>

									<article>
										<p>Overall, I really enjoyed making this map, and I believe I was successful in achieving my goal of creating a moderate-large sized map, 
										with balanced soldier, vehicle, and air vehicle gameplay. I learned a lot about map flow, and affordances while playtesting and iterating on the map, and I feel
										that my level design experience has improved.
										</p>
										<p>While I am happy about the final design, I feel that the map could have been larger, in terms of its width.
										The width feels like a decent size for foot-soldier gameplay, but when players start to drive around, it 
										feels a little small on the width. This could have been found out if I play tested some more during the
										grey boxing stage, and played with the vehicles a bit more, and I feel the design could’ve been better if I 
										did so. But overall, the design matches what I wanted out of my map, and I am satisfied with the results for now.</p>
