									<br/><p>This is the third project I have been a part of while at LGG (Little Guy Games). After the soft release of Super Racer, I was placed onto this team, to assist in development for an Xbox release. While on this project, I have participated in
									code reviews, code feedback, design meetings, and project management.
									</p><p>I performed multiple programming tasks for the duration of this project, while also performing general development tasks as well. My main contributions are ai development and game mechanics.

							<article id = "AI">
								<h2 align = center> AI Development </h2> <hr/>				
									<br/><p>For this project, I implemented a node-based system that the AI would use at their behaviour tree. Alongside the behaviour tree, the AI components needed a modular structure so that the nodes could be used for all sorts of AI, while still allowing different AI
									to have different functionality. For example, there is a 'wraith' enemy and a 'golem' enemy. Both ai behave very differently, and have different attacks. But, their components inherit from the same base classes, and as a result they are both able to use the behaviour tree system.
									</p><p>
									I was tasked with designing and developing two AI; a raven and a wraith / ghost.
									</p>
									<p>I was also co-developing several other enemies alonside other programmers, mainly assisting with new features and bugs, but also assisted in training on how to use the system.

								<h2 align = center> Level Design </h2> <hr/>				
									<br/><p>When first assigned this project, I was given the task of designing and prototyping new game mechanics for puzzle solving. Using Titanfall 2 as reference, I prototyped a time-travel mechanic, where 
									the player would travel between their child-self and adult-self, while the environment around them would also change. With this new mechanic developed, I was then tasked with creating a new level based upon
									this new mechanic. 
									</p><p>
									When designing the level, I began by plotting out the general story points that would occur in the level. Doing this helped me estimate how long each section should be between each story point, and how long
									the level should be in total. I then started to greybox some quick prototypes of the level. As the level would be oriented around time travel, I ended up designing two versions of the level, trying to determine
									how each time period would differ from each other, and how they would affect each other. After fully grey-boxing the level, I passed it over to the artists, with some in-world notes on how I predicted each section to look.

									<article>
										<p>While working on Super Racer, I learned & developed much of my existing technical and soft skills.</p>
									</article>								

										<div id = "Programming Lead">
											<p>One of the major lessons was learning how to manage and delegate tasks as the programming lead.</p>
											
											<p>This was my first time being a lead in a professional workplace, and I learned much while in this role. As the programming lead, I had an overview of the project, 
											it's current state, and what tasks needed to be done to meet the current milestone. As I was also a programmer on the project, I was able to understand the current 
											state of each part of the game as well. As a result, I was able to quickly determine where issues could present themselves, and create plans to reduce their impact. 
											While meeting with the lead designer & project manager, I would bring up time estimates to assist in creating accurate milestones and predictions.</p>
											
											<br/>
											<p>I also greatly developed my programming skills, while working on various programming tasks. </p>
											
											<p>Before working on this project, I was generally a game systems & AI programming. Although I was assigned systems & AI tasks on Super Racer as well, I was also given tasks I havent 
											worked with before, such as the <b>vehicle controller physics</b>, various gameplay mechanics, and <b>database integration</b>. I especially developed my knowledge on <b>Unity custom inspectors & editor tools</b>, which have allowed
											me to speed up other areas of development.</p>
