								<article id = "long project details">
									<br/><p>This was the third project I have been a part of while at LGG (Little Guy Games). After the soft release of Super Racer, I was placed onto this team, to assist in development for an Xbox release. While on this project, I had participated in
									code reviews, code feedback, design meetings, and project management.
									</p><p>I performed multiple design oriented tasks for the duration of this project, while also performing programming and general development tasks as well. My main contributions are 2 level designs & AI designs/system development.

								<h2 align = center> Level Design </h2> <hr/>				
								<br/>
								<p>During this project, I was tasked with level design, while also prototyping new puzzle mechanics. I created multiple puzzle systems around the theme of time alteration.  
								</p>
								<p>My process for level design started with organizing the narrative of the level. I worked with the narrative designer to get an idea of the key story points that they wanted portrayed throughout the level, and from
									there I plotted them out within a blank level. By doing this, I was able to estimate how much time should be between each story point, and how long the overall level was. This also helped me plot out a rough layout of the level.
									After plotting out the narrative points and creating a rough outline of the level, I moved onto grey boxing the level by creating the rough geometry, and determining puzzle layouts and designs.
								</p>
								<br/>
								<p>From here, I would gather playtesting feedback, and then adjust the levels. Throughout the multiple iteration periods, I would work with the level artist to decorate the level.

								<br/>
								<p>
									The main challenge I had when designing the 2 levels was maintaining the different 'time eras' throughout the level. I based this mechanic off of the Titanfall 2 level, 'Effect and Cause', and researched their design techniques when creating that mission. Ultimately, our 
									mechanic was more linear, as the player didn't have full control over where they were able to time jump, so much of my level design wasn't different from creating a normal level. However, in the areas where the player could time jump,
									I had to balance each area so that each area had it's purpose, and made sense narratively.

							<article id = "AI">
								<h2 align = center> AI Development </h2> <hr/>				
									<br/><p>For this project, I implemented a node-based system that the AI would use at their behaviour tree. Alongside the behaviour tree, the AI components needed a modular structure so that the nodes could be used for all sorts of AI, while still allowing different AI
									to have different functionality. For example, there is a 'wraith' enemy and a 'golem' enemy. Both ai behave very differently, and have different attacks. But, their components inherit from the same base classes, and as a result they are both able to use the behaviour tree system.
									</p><p>
									I was tasked with designing and developing two AI; a raven and a wraith / ghost. <br/>
									I also assisted with the design & development of several other AI; the spider, the hellhound, and the golem. I mainly assisting with new ai systems and bugs, but also trained others on how to use the system.

								<h2 align = center> Junior Mentoring</h2> <hr/>				
									<br/><p>This project was the first time I would mentor a junior intern while working on a project.
									</p><p>
										While mentoring my goal was to help my junior further develop their skills in the areas that we planned out when initially meeting. I would routinely check up with them,
										review their work, and re-evaluate our schedule & goals if necessary, in order to help them get the best experience they could out of this internship.									
									</p><p>
										Overall, I really enjoyed the experience of mentoring, and look forward to further mentoring sometime in the future!
