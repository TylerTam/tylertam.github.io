								<h2 align = center>Purpose & Goal </h2> <hr/>
								
								<p>My main goal of this project is to increase my unreal exposure and experience within the editor, and to create a portfolio project showing this. </p>
								<p>In terms of game design, my goal is to create a fast & engaging gameplay loop, with combat similar to Red Hood in Arkham Knight, but with the addition of more
								gunplay elements & third person shooter designs as well.
								</p>
							</article>
							
							<br/><br/>
							
							<article id = "The project so far">
								<h2 align = center>2024 June 03</h2><hr/>
								<p>The project has been put on hold indefinitely, as I begin a new role at Epic Games. </p>
								
								<h2 align = center>2024 February 02</h2> <hr/>
								
								<p>I took a little hiatus on this project, to think more about what the actual gameplay would look like. After developing the idea a bit more, I decided to create a TPS squad based hero run & gun type of game, and restarted work on this project.</p>
								<p>With the new design in mind, I removed some mechanics that I had previously implemented that I felt no longer worked with the game;</p>
								<ul style = "text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
									<li>Weapon Pickup</li>
									<li>Executions</li>									
									<li>Jump (as a standard ability)</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>
								I then began implementing some new features that I felt the new design would need.
								</p>
								<p>
								<b>Cover System</b><br/>
									When positioned behind cover, the player can pop-out to the left or right. If the cover is short, they can also pop-out over the object. <br/>
									This system is different from typical cover systems, where players press a button to 'snap' to cover, as I feel that this version might fit the gameplay style of this game (run & gun) a bit more. Of course, if I feel it doesn't fit later on, I'm open to changing it.<br/>

								<b>Squad System</b><br/>
								I've recently replayed Left 4 Dead, and was inspired to create a similar squad based system of 4 characters. This iteration lets the player select 4 characters, before launching the mission. During the mission, they can freely swap between the characters.<br/>
								The idea is that the characters would have their own skills, abilities and equipment, much like a hero-based game.<br/>

								<h2 align = center>2023 November 30</h2> <hr/>
								
								<p>At the moment, I've been working mostly on the character controller, to get a great feeling controller, with fun to use abilities. </p>
								<p>I decided that, alongside typical shooter abilities & mechanics, the player will also have electric-based powers that give the feeling of being an action hero.
								Some of these mechanics include a electrified ground pound, and a electric 'dash'. Also, the player's bullets become electrified when using their powers and shooting, which can electrocute the targets.

							<article id = "Design Process">
								<h2 align = center> Design Process </h2> <hr/>				
								<br/>
								<p>I began pre-planning by re-reviewing my design document for my unreal tournament level, as I really liked the process I went through and documented. After
								reviewing it's process, I loosely planned out how I believed my process for this level would progress. This helped me get a better idea of what was necessary for
								the design.
								</p>
								
								<p>In general, my process looked similar to the following list:
								
									<ul>
										<li>Pre-planning / brainstorming</li>
										<li>Diagram layouts</li>
										<li>In-engine metric greybox</li>
										<li>Gameplay elements placements</li>
										<li>Initial art pass</li>
										<li>Playtest</li>
										<li>Fixes & additional art passes</li>
										<li>Second Playtest</li>
										<li>Final Touches</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Typically, I would run a playtest before an initial art pass, just to test geometry, gameplay flow, and balancing, while the set dressing models are being created.
								But, since Forge already had the assets I would be using, going along with the art pass saved time. Additionally, placing some props really helped me get a better
								idea of how players would move about in the different spaces.
								</p>
								<br/>
								
							</article>
							<article id = "PrePlanning">
								<h2 align = center> Pre-Planning</h2> <hr/>				
								<br/>
								<p>I began by thinking of environments that might be interesting for a 12v12. I had a few environments in mind; an underwater base, a forest, and an ice cavern. 
								Ultimately, I decided on creating a level based around a large water dam. I felt that the large drop on one side of the dam would be an interesting play space for
								a Wasp (a flying vehicle), and the ground level of the dam would be a nice large space for both vehicle and foot soldier gameplay.
								</p>
								
								<p>After deciding the environment, I brainstormed some interesting structures that would be great set pieces, while also presenting some great gameplay opportunities.
								I looked to existing dams, as well as existing structures in the Halo universe for some inspiration. In Halo CE, at the beginning of <i>Assault on the Control Room</i> 
								a large forerunner structure is present, and I really liked the design and size of this structure, and I planned for the main structure of my level to look / behave similar to
								it.
								</p>
								
								<p>One aspect that I really wanted to incorporate into this level was verticality in the gameplay. Aside from the Wasp, I wanted players to have the option of climbing up structures 
								and gain some height, as I always enjoyed these types of maps in previous Halos.
								</p>
								<p>After some more brainstorming, and ideation, I began to create some diagrams to map the connections of each space to eachother.</p>
								
							</article>
							<br/>
							<article id = "Diagrams">
								<h2 align = center> Diagrams</h2> <hr/>				
								<br/>
								<p>I started off with some bubble diagrams to get a better idea of how each space should connect to other spaces. This step really helped me identify how the different levels
								of vertical movement should interact with each other, and how players should be able to travel between the different spaces. As these diagrams were from a top-down view, I created
								multiple bubble diagrams, layered on top of each other, and it was easy to switch layers and see the space connections.
								</p>
								<div class = "desktop" align = center>
									<a class="example-image-link" href="images/WaterDamage/BubbleDiagram.gif" data-lightbox="galleryDesktop">
										<img  style = "width: 35%;"   src="images/WaterDamage/BubbleDiagram.gif" alt="" />		
									</a>
								</div>
								
								<p>After creating the bubble diagrams, I wanted to plan out the interior of the central building in the dam. I moved over to a side-view of the building, which allowed me to 
								plan for the elevation. During this step, I planned out the geometry for the building, including aspects like stair/ramp placements, gravity lift placements, and room placements.
								This diagram proved to be extremely helpful in having a better idea of what the interior should look like, which made the scultping, using Forge pieces, much much easier.
								</p>
								<p>I also made a side-view diagram for the team bases, since I found the central building diagram really helped. Since the bases were going to be mirrored, I only created one for the red team.
								</p>

									<article>
										<p>Overall, I really enjoyed making this map, and I believe I was successful in achieving my goal of creating a moderate-large sized map, 
										with balanced soldier, vehicle, and air vehicle gameplay. I learned a lot about map flow, and affordances while playtesting and iterating on the map, and I feel
										that my level design experience has improved.
										</p>
										<p>While I am happy about the final design, I feel that the map could have been larger, in terms of its width.
										The width feels like a decent size for foot-soldier gameplay, but when players start to drive around, it 
										feels a little small on the width. This could have been found out if I play tested some more during the
										grey boxing stage, and played with the vehicles a bit more, and I feel the design could’ve been better if I 
										did so. But overall, the design matches what I wanted out of my map, and I am satisfied with the results for now.</p>
