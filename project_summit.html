									<br/><p>During the development of Summit, I worked alongside a second programmer,
										as well as the artist in charge of items and ui art, and the level 
										designer.Â 
									</p><p>My main role was to implement game systems, such as the inventory systems, day/night system, and sound systems. To make these systems work within the 
									game world, I worked alongside the game designer to implement and tweak these systems.

									<br/><br/>
									I also took on secondary roles as a sound designer, UI designer, and VFX programmer. <br/> 
									As the <b>sound designer</b>, I fetched, retrieved, and mixed all of the sounds in the game, many of which are foley recordings, with little post-recording effects added on. <br/>
									As the <b> UI designer</b> I created and implemented all the ui and their systems in the game, including the inventory menu, pause menu, and game world ui.<br/>
									As the <b>VFX programmer</b> I worked alongside a second VFX programmer to produce shaders using HLSL.

											<p>My solution to this was a simple grid-based system, where each grid cell recalls the data and icon of the item to occupies. When an item is

								<h2 align = center> Sound Design </h2> <hr/>
								<p>During this project, I wanted to explore another aspect of development, to better understand how it functions. As the team required a sound designer, I took on that role.
								</p>
								<p>Since the game takes place in a more modern type setting, many of the sounds were easy to retrieve and implement without much editing afterwards. 
								However, there were some sounds that would be difficult to aqcuire with our limited resources, such as the tree impact sound, and any that I found didn't 
								match what I was aiming for. </p>
								
								<p>As a result, some mixing would need to be involved. In the case of the tree impact, I recorded a small christmas tree being thrown, and mixed it with 
								a wood impact sound, to give a deeper impact sound, and also added in a clip of leaves being rustled, to add more secondary layers. </p>
