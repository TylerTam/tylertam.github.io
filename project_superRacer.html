									<br/><p>I was hired at LGG (Little Guy Games) in May 2021, and was moved to project Super Racer in August 2021. I was originally tasked with various programming tasks, such as AI
									development, and game systems, and was promoted to Lead Game Programmer in January 2022. As the lead programmer, I was tasked with overseeing all the on-going game programming tasks, while 
									also planningÂ for future implementation.
									</p><p>I performed multiple programming tasks for the duration of this project, while also performing general development tasks as well. These tasks included:
									
									<ul style = "text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
										<li>Database integration</li>
										<li>Vehicle gameplay design & tweaking</li>
										<li>Vehicle paintjob designer</li>									
										<li>Economy Design</li>
										<li>Gameplay Design</li>
										<li>Sound retrieval / implentation</li>

									<article>
										<p>While working on Super Racer, I learned & developed much of my existing technical and soft skills.</p>
									</article>								

										<div id = "Programming Lead">
											<p>One of the major lessons was learning how to manage and delegate tasks as the programming lead.</p>
											
											<p>This was my first time being a lead in a professional workplace, and I learned much while in this role. As the programming lead, I had an overview of the project, 
											it's current state, and what tasks needed to be done to meet the current milestone. As I was also a programmer on the project, I was able to understand the current 
											state of each part of the game as well. As a result, I was able to quickly determine where issues could present themselves, and create plans to reduce their impact. 
											While meeting with the lead designer & project manager, I would bring up time estimates to assist in creating accurate milestones and predictions.</p>
											
											<br/>
											<p>I also greatly developed my programming skills, while working on various programming tasks. </p>
											
											<p>Before working on this project, I was generally a game systems & AI programming. Although I was assigned systems & AI tasks on Super Racer as well, I was also given tasks I havent 
											worked with before, such as the <b>vehicle controller physics</b>, various gameplay mechanics, and <b>database integration</b>. I especially developed my knowledge on <b>Unity custom inspectors & editor tools</b>, which have allowed
											me to speed up other areas of development.</p>
